# 🌌 Arcood-Made — AI vs HI Hackathon

**"Arcood-Made"** is a playful, immersive web experience where **emotions take planetary form** and only humans can navigate them.

Built for the **AI vs HI Hackathon**, this project mixes emotion, creativity, and interactivity — the things that make us deeply human.

### ❌ Exit Button – The Gage Game

Feeling done with emotions? Hit the **Exit** button…  
…but beware, it launches a **fun little dare game** to keep the human spirit alive before you go.

## 🧠 Why It's Human

- Emotions are irrational, messy, and hard to define — things AI can't replicate.
- Each planet reflects **a sensory and emotional experience**, combining visuals, sound, and symbolism.
- This project is about **celebrating the chaos of being human**, not simplifying it.
- It doesn’t try to fix your feelings — it simply gives you **space** to feel them.
